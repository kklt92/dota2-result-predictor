Through our project, we want to help players to understand the game better and select better combination of heroes in a team. \r\n\r\n## Solution\r\nWe use logistic regression to predict the outcome of a game.\r\nOur feature is which hero is chosen in a team. Because once the heroes are decided, the attributes such as hero types and hero skills are determinate, picked heroes for each team are the most important attribute to predict a game.\r\nThe result of prediction is also a binary variable. If Radiant wins, the outcome will be 1. If Dire wins, it will be 0. \r\n\r\n## Test\r\nWe use a binary vector X ∈R^220  (initial value=0) as our data set, encoding the presence or absence of a hero in the “Radiant” and the “Dire” teams. For example, if hero no.100 is in Radiant, x_110=1. \r\nTo train this binary data set, we use simple logistic regression model, using a weighted sum of our feature vector. After training, we implement 10-fold cross validation to get the accuracy of this model. The accuracy of our model is 60.6%, which we think is pretty high for a Dota2 game.\r\n\r\n## Result\r\nThe result of 10-fold cross validation is 60.6%. This result indicates that hero selection is a main factor to win a game. There are other factors that will infect a game but are difficult for us to capture and represent, like the environmental factors and the status of a player. \r\n\r\n### Team members\r\n[Huaipei Lu](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/huaipei-lu/a1/2b8/766/en) (hlv624), [Weihao Ming](https://www.linkedin.com/in/weihaoming) (wml431), [Jiaping Tian](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tjiap) (jtl428), [Chen Meng](https://www.linkedin.com/pub/晨-孟/a7/96b/1b1/en) (cmb654)\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\nHaving trouble with dota2 result predictor?
